//! Account authority check (architecture §4.8, Decisions D6/D7).
//!
//! Pure logic over an in-memory account rule-set model (as if read from
//! `getLedgerEntries`). It answers one question, fail-closed and for a stated scope — the new
//! rule's target, the account's management surface (`Default`, `CallContract(account)`) and
//! the bound policies: *who can change this account or reset the policies being installed, and
//! can the restricted key reach the target outside the new limit?* Who else can call the
//! target is shown for information: their access is their own, not a way around the agent's
//! limit. It never answers "is it safe": whether the listed
//! identities are the user's own, or trusted by the user, is decided by the wallet that holds
//! the owner key (Decision D7), which recomputes this result itself rather than trusting one
//! it is handed. Rules for other contracts are listed as coverage exclusions, never declared
//! harmless.
//!
//! The result has three blocking parts and some notes:
//! - `authority_list` — every live rule that can change the account or reach a bound policy,
//!   each as the identities who must all sign;
//! - `refusals` — unconditional inside the scope: the agent's own key can change the account
//!   or reset a bound policy alone, another rule on the target lets it around the new limit,
//!   the new rule targets something it must not, or an in-scope rule has a shape this version
//!   does not support;
//! - `unresolved` — evidence missing inside the scope (a classic account that was not read, a
//!   verifier whose code was not observed).
//!
//! Why these rules matter: the account's management methods (`add_context_rule`,
//! `remove_policy`, `add_signer`, …) and every bound policy's `install` / `uninstall` are
//! guarded only by the account's own authorization, and `CallContract` scoping discards
//! function names. So any live rule matching the account's address (or `Default`, which
//! matches everything) can strip the new rule of its policies; any rule matching a bound
//! policy can uninstall and reinstall it to reset its counters; and any other rule on the
//! target is a second way to call it.
//!
//! Accepted forms are surface-specific (OZ `stellar-accounts` 0.7.2, `storage.rs`
//! `get_validated_context_by_id` and `do_check_auth`). A rule that can change the account or
//! reach a bound policy must be policy-free: every signer must sign. A rule with policies skips
//! that check, lets the submitter choose it, and hands whatever signers authenticated —
//! possibly none — to its policies, so on those surfaces any policy is refused. On the target,
//! a rule is described by its policies' established semantics (a recognized policy demanding
//! at least one of the rule's own signers), never projected to "all of" from its stored signer
//! list; an unreadable one is refused. A classic-account signer authorizes through the classic
//! account's own signers and thresholds, so it is one identity only when its entry exists and
//! its master key alone meets the medium threshold. Contract (nested-account) signers and
//! unrecognized external verifiers are refused by name. There is no dominance algebra and no
//! override.
//!
//! Enumeration is `bounded_next_id` (D6): read `NextId` + extant `Count` + the rule entries
//! and their transitive signer/policy closure; a count deficit or a missing transitive entry
//! fails closed (`E_INCOMPLETE_ACCOUNT_STATE`) rather than yielding a partial answer — an
//! archived rule could be restored and used in the same invocation.
//!
//! The refusals work on key material, so the restricted key is recognized whether stored as a
//! classic account or as raw key bytes behind a verifier (sharing its first 32 bytes). The
//! `authority_commitment` binds the authority-relevant state and the exact install intent;
//! ledger numbers and TTLs do not move it, while any change to the account's stored rules —
//! in scope or not — does (the safe direction: approval is asked again).

/// Identity of the enumerated state a result was computed over, so a consumer can tell

/// **Domain.** `ACCOUNT_STATE`, which names this structure. Not `REGISTRY_SNAPSHOT`, which names
/// another one — two structures under one domain forfeit the separation the domains exist for.
/// Not `SURFACE_VERDICT` either: that names the whole result, digested separately as
/// `authority_commitment`.
///
/// **Version prefix.** Present, matching `spec_hash`, `recording_hash`, `BuildManifest::hash`
/// and `snapshot_root`. The workspace is not uniform here — `signer_set_hash`,
/// `codegen_input_hash`, `binding_set_hash` and `auth_fingerprint` omit it, so a
/// canonicalization bump would move four of the eight preimages and leave four still. That
/// inconsistency is real and is not this function's to resolve; the prefix is included because
/// the alternative is to add a fifth omission.
///
/// **Ordering.** The maps in `AccountState` are `BTreeMap`, but `StoredRule::signer_ids` and
/// `policy_ids` are `Vec<u32>`, so their order is part of the digest. `check` does not depend on
/// that order — it reads both as sets — so permuting a rule's ids yields a different digest for
/// a state the logic treats as identical. The direction is safe: the consumer sees "state
/// changed" and re-runs a check that returns the same answer. Normalizing the vecs into the
/// preimage would remove the spurious difference, and would also silently equate two stored
/// states that the account itself stores differently.
///
/// **Fallible rather than lossy.** A serialization failure must not resolve to a digest. Falling
/// back to empty bytes would hand every failing state the same identity, and a consumer
/// comparing digests would read that as a match.
