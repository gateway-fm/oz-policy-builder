/// updated 2025-03-12): an assertion by the builder about how an artifact was produced. The
/// rebuild route is **SEP-58 — Contract Build Reproducibility for Verification** (Draft, version
/// 0.6.0, updated 2026-07-15), keyed on a required `source_sha256` over the bytes of a source
/// archive with an optional `source_uri` — a vocabulary still moving, since those two replaced
/// `source_repo`/`source_rev`/`tarball_url`/`tarball_sha256` in v0.4.0, and since on 16 July its
/// author was still establishing whether `--meta` has to be passed at verification time. An
/// implementation exists and no released `stellar-cli` carries it: `build --backend docker` and
/// `contract build verify` come from the `feat/reproducible-builds-via-docker` branch of
/// `stellar-cli#2525`. Our case is also outside what the SEP covers — a generated contract has no
/// source archive at all — and that question is on our agenda for `stellar-protocol#1923`.
///
/// The signal to replace it, then, is not a date: **SEP-58 leaving Draft and its support shipping
