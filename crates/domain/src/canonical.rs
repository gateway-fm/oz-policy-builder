//! Canonical hashing: every hashed structure is encoded as an `ScVal` and hashed as XDR.
//!
//! # Why XDR rather than JSON
//!
//! These hashes are the project's evidence: they are what lets someone other than us confirm that
//! a given wasm was produced from the specification a user reviewed. That only works if both
//! sides can reproduce the same bytes, so the encoding has to be specified somewhere other than
//! in our source.
//!
//! XDR is that specification, and it is the format the rest of the ecosystem already speaks:
//! every Stellar SDK ships a codec generated from one schema, so implementations agree by
//! construction rather than by agreement. The architecture asks for "a specified canonical
//! encoding" and already prescribes canonical XDR for the authorization fingerprint
//! (`docs/architecture.md:247`); this brings the remaining preimages to the same footing.
//!
//! # The preimage
//!
//! ```text
//! preimage = ScVal::Vec [ ScVal::U32(canonicalization version)
//!                       , ScVal::String(domain)
//!                       , <encoded value>
//!                       ]
//! hash     = SHA-256(preimage encoded as XDR)
//! ```
//!
//! The domain travels **inside** the preimage, which is how the protocol does it: `HashIdPreimage`
//! is a union whose discriminant identifies the structure, and the hash is taken over the whole
//! encoded union. We deliberately do **not** reuse that union or any `EnvelopeType` discriminant.
//! Those numbers are a registry the protocol owns: taking one would mean a future protocol
//! addition silently collides with our hashes, and it would assert to any tool reading the bytes
//! that our specification is a protocol object, which is false. The pattern is what transfers —
//! a versioned, tagged structure hashed as XDR — with our own tag space.
//!
//! The tag is the domain constant itself (`ozpb:v1:policy-spec` and friends), carried as
//! `ScVal::String` rather than `ScVal::Symbol` because those constants contain `:` and `-`, which
//! `Symbol` does not admit. Reusing them avoids a second parallel list of tags: this crate has
//! already needed a test to stop one hand-maintained list of domains falling behind the
//! constants, and a second list would need the same. Note the `v1` inside a domain constant is
//! the *schema* version of that structure and is not the canonicalization version, which is the
//! separate `U32` above — the architecture treats those as distinct and so does this.
//!
//! # The encoding rules
//!
//! Written out because an external implementation has to follow them, and because "canonical"
//! is a claim that has to be checkable rather than asserted. The mapping is from serde's data
//! model, so the JSON wire form and this preimage are two encodings of one schema: a reader
//! holding our JSON can derive the `ScVal` from these rules alone.
//!
//! | Rust / serde | `ScVal` |
//! |---|---|
//! | `bool` | `Bool` |
//! | `i8` `i16` `i32` | `I32` |
//! | `i64` | `I64` |
//! | `i128` | `I128` |
//! | `u8` `u16` `u32` | `U32` |
//! | `u64` | `U64` |
//! | `u128` | `U128` |
//! | `f32` `f64` | **rejected** |
//! | `char`, `&str`, `String` | `String` |
//! | `&[u8]` | `Bytes` |
//! | `None` | `Vec []` |
//! | `Some(v)` | `Vec [v]` |
//! | `()`, unit struct | `Void` |
//! | newtype struct | the inner value, transparently |
//! | sequence, tuple, tuple struct | `Vec` |
//! | named struct | `Map`, keys `Symbol(field name)` |
//! | map | `Map`, keys the **encoded key** |
//! | unit variant | `Vec [Symbol(variant)]` |
//! | newtype variant | `Vec [Symbol(variant), inner]` |
//! | tuple variant | `Vec [Symbol(variant), fields…]` |
//! | struct variant | `Vec [Symbol(variant), Map]` |
//!
//! Four of those need their reasoning stated, because a different choice would have been
//! defensible and the difference is invisible until it bites.
//!
//! **Struct field names are `Symbol`s; map keys are not.** A field name is part of the schema and
//! fits `Symbol`'s charset and 32-byte limit — and holding it to that limit is useful, since it
//! fails loudly on a name no `ScVal` could carry. A map *key* is data: this project's maps are
//! keyed by 64-character hex hashes, 56-character strkeys, and template families like
//! `policy-templates/scope@1`, none of which are legal `Symbol`s. Keys are therefore encoded by
//! the same rules as any other value, which makes them `String`s here.
//!
//! **`Option` is wrapped rather than flattened.** Soroban's own convention maps `None` to `Void`
//! and `Some(v)` to `v`, which is compact but makes `None` and `Some(())` the same bytes. Wrapping
//! in a `Vec` costs a few bytes and makes the ambiguity unrepresentable, which is the trade this
//! project makes everywhere else.
//!
//! **Floats are rejected at encode time.** `clippy.toml` already bans them, but a lint is a
//! policy and this is a property: no float can reach a hash even through a type this crate has
//! never seen. `ScVal` has no float variant either, so the rejection matches the platform.
//!
//! **Map ordering is not ours to define.** `ScMap::sorted_from_entries` sorts by key and then
//! validates, and `impl Validate for ScMap` requires strictly ascending keys, which also rejects
//! duplicates. Writing our own comparison would be reimplementing a rule the ecosystem already
//! publishes — and getting it subtly different is exactly how two implementations stop agreeing.
