//! Pure recorder core (architecture §4.1, §4.11).
//!
//! Acquisition adapters (`source-rpc`, `source-bundle`) produce immutable, trust-labeled
//! [`EvidenceSnapshot`]s; this crate is a pure function over snapshots:
//! `record(snapshot, options) -> RecordingBundle`. No I/O, no async.
//!
//! Enforcement facts come exclusively from the authorization entries (what
//! `__check_auth` will see); token movements and state diffs are explanatory evidence.
//! Args in an auth entry are what was *authorized* (`require_auth_for_args` may differ
//! from the actual call args) and are labeled as such.

// is. Where evidence crosses a serialization boundary the label is therefore downgraded
