# clippy also carries the hash-determinism gate: `clippy.toml` disallows `HashMap`/`HashSet`
# (per-process iteration order) and floats (no faithful JSON form, absent from `ScVal`) so the
# rule that keeps serialized bytes stable is checked rather than stated in a comment.
#
# Both workspaces, because the root `Cargo.toml` excludes `contracts` and `--workspace` therefore
# never reaches it. `clippy.toml` does apply there — clippy walks up to the repository root to
# find it — so a single invocation would leave this gate reporting a pass while the contracts
# workspace held a banned type. That is the shape of defect this gate exists to prevent, and CI
# lints the two workspaces separately for the same reason.
#
# fmt needs three invocations, for a stronger version of the same reason, and had only one until
# 30 differences had piled up behind it. `--all` means "the members of this workspace", and the
# generated policy crate is not a member of one: `contracts` excludes it, since it carries its own
# `[profile.release]` so it builds standalone as it ships. Running fmt in `contracts` does reach
# golden-transfer-policy, but only through the differential suite's dev-dependency on it — an edge
# that exists for testing, not for coverage, and one a later milestone may move — so the crate is
# named rather than relied upon. Four of the 30 differences were in it, which makes them a defect
# in the code generator rather than in a checked-in file.

# Each name is required to have MATCHED at least one passing test rather than merely to have
# exited 0, because `cargo test <filter>` exits 0 when the filter matches nothing: a gate
# naming a test that was renamed, moved, or never existed here keeps reporting a pass while
# asserting nothing whatsoever. That is not hypothetical — this gate carried a third name that
# matched no test in this tree, and its green said so about a property nobody was checking.
# Matched with bash's own regex rather than through a pipe to `grep -q`: under `pipefail`, grep
# exiting the moment it matches leaves the test binary killed by SIGPIPE, and the pipeline
# reports that death — so the check failed on a test that had just passed.
