# Launch the MCP server with the development registry trust configured, for an editor or agent
# session started in this repository (see `.mcp.json`).
#
# `synthesize_policy` refuses to run until OZPB_REGISTRY_ROOTS_JSON and OZPB_REGISTRY_MIN_VERSION
# are set, and that refusal is deliberate: the server verifies a request's registry snapshot
# against roots the *operator* configured, so a request cannot bring its own trust root. This
# wrapper supplies the committed development roots — suitable for a local session and for the
# demo, and not a production trust configuration.
#
# The roots are read from the committed file rather than pasted into `.mcp.json`, so there is one
# copy to keep correct instead of two.
#
# It also configures one RPC source, named `testnet`, for the tools that read through an operator
# source rather than a URL in the request (`check_policy_call_surface`, `prepare_install_intent`,
# `assemble_install_transaction`, `check_against_policy`, `capture_target`; `prepare_dry_run`
# validates it without reading). Testnet only: the passphrase is fixed here and any
# `OZPB_RPC_SOURCES_JSON` already in the environment is replaced. The endpoint defaults to SDF's
# public testnet RPC; `OZPB_DEV_TESTNET_RPC_URL` may name another plain `https://` endpoint for
# the same network; the reads compare the network an endpoint reports with that passphrase.
