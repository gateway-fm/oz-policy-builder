//   consent  the browser returns the statement's hash; only then is the replay obligation recorded
//            and the unsigned owner entry released for the passkey.
//   run      checks the owner's passkey signature, has the live capability sign the delegate's two

//   replay   once every case signature has expired, re-reads what they could have changed.
