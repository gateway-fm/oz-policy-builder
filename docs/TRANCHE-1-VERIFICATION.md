# Tranche 1 verification guide

This is the acceptance path for a Stellar Community Fund reviewer evaluating Tranche 1 of
the OZ Accounts Policy Builder. It reduces the milestone to claims a reviewer can reproduce
from the public repository; the architecture documents more than this tranche delivers.

The contracted milestone is recorded in [public issue #1][tranche-issue]. Its outcome is:
a recorded testnet transfer becomes a minimum-permission Rust policy that the pinned
`stellar contract build` accepts. Tranche 1 also delivers the recording and synthesis
operations through an MCP server v0.

## Known-good public evidence

The manually dispatched [`nightly live` run #33529227155][passing-run] passed on 2026-09-01
at public `main` revision [`064b76cc`][verified-revision]. It exercised:

- the recorded Rust and Stellar CLI build-input pins;
- a real Stellar-contract build and a byte-identical full clean rebuild;
- the real-toolchain boundary tests; and
- the complete Tranche 1 flow against live Stellar testnet, then its fail-closed check.

That run is evidence for the named revision, not a substitute for reproducing the checks.
The `nightly live` workflow also runs every day and can be dispatched manually from GitHub.

## 1. Run the release gate

Clone the public repository and use the revision being reviewed. To reproduce the known-good
run exactly, check out `064b76cc2a172e798a49e057735f6d692cb4e1b7`.

The repository pins Rust 1.91.1 (including `wasm32v1-none`) in `rust-toolchain.toml`. The full
release gate additionally requires Python 3, network access for the RustSec advisory database,
and these tools. Use the pinned versions below to reproduce CI's verdict:

- `stellar-cli` 27.0.0 — the workflow records its revision and release-asset checksum;
- `cargo-deny` 0.20.2; and
- `cargo-machete` 0.9.2.

The checksum-verified Linux installation of `stellar-cli` used by CI is in
`.github/workflows/nightly-live.yml`. Install the two Cargo tools with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-deny --locked --version 0.20.2
cargo install cargo-machete --locked --version 0.9.2
```

The release gate checks that the configured Rust and Stellar CLI pins agree with its recorded
build provenance before it starts the expensive checks:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-phase1.sh
```

Success ends with:

```text
ALL PHASE 1 RELEASE GATES PASSED
```

This single gate covers both Cargo workspaces and the excluded generated policy crate. It
checks dependency boundaries, publication invariants, formatting, warnings, tests, the
reference-evaluator differential suite, deterministic code generation, clean-build Wasm
reproducibility, real-builder reconciliation, licences, advisories, sources, and unused
dependencies. `--offline` is an explicitly reduced developer check and is not sufficient for
acceptance.

## 2. Reproduce the live Tranche 1 outcome

The live demo needs testnet access. It creates throwaway, Friendbot-funded identities in a
temporary configuration directory and deletes their secrets at exit. It does not use real
value, request a user's signature, or install the generated policy.

```bash
bash scripts/demo-tranche1.sh
```

A successful run exits zero and prints the retained artifact directory. Its final three
assertions are the milestone in executable form:

1. the pinned `stellar contract build` accepts the generated crate without hand edits;
2. the same `PolicySpec` produces byte-identical source and the same recorded Wasm hash; and
3. changing only the observed account code hash to an unknown value is refused with
   `E_INCOMPATIBLE_ACCOUNT` rather than producing a policy.

Open `MANIFEST.md` in the printed directory first. It inventories every input and output. The
most useful files for independent inspection are:

| Artifact | What to verify |
| --- | --- |
| `03-recording.json` | The RPC observation, authorization call, arguments, signer evidence, and token movement that entered synthesis. |
| `04-spec.json` | The exact-by-default constraints and their provenance. |
| `05-policy/src/contract.rs` | The readable generated policy, including signer checks, limits, and named refusal paths. |
| `05-policy/build-manifest.json` | The spec, source, registry, Wasm, toolchain, and build-argument identities bound together by the build. |
| `07-policy-again/` | A second generation of the same spec; the script requires it to match `05-policy/`. |
| `08-account-tampered.json` and `08-refusal.txt` | The one-field negative case and the required fail-closed result. |

The directory is the review artifact: it can be archived and handed to someone who did not
watch the command run.

## 3. Check each contracted deliverable

| Contracted item | Primary check | Supporting evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recording layer | Live demo steps 1–3 | `crates/recorder-core`, `crates/source-rpc`, and `docs/TESTNET-EVIDENCE.md` §1 |
| Synthesizer v1 | Live demo step 4 and its tampered-input refusal | `crates/synthesizer` and the release-gate test suite |
| OZ `spending_limit` plus minimal custom `Policy` | Read the registry-resolved spec and generated `contract.rs` | `contracts/golden-transfer-policy` and `scripts/verify-pinned-upstream.sh` |
| MCP server v0 (`record` / `synthesize`) | Release-gate MCP tests | `docs/MCP-WALKTHROUGH.md` and `docs/TESTNET-EVIDENCE.md` §3 |
| Compilable Rust policy | Live demo steps 5–7 | The passing `nightly live` run and release-gate Wasm checks |

For the slowest independent trust-anchor check, run:

```bash
bash scripts/verify-pinned-upstream.sh
```

It clones the pinned OpenZeppelin tag, rebuilds all three pinned upstream contracts with the
recorded compiler, and compares their Wasm hashes. Two are Phase 1 trust anchors; the retained
ed25519-verifier pin is for later work. The script is intentionally separate from the release
gate because it performs a cold build of another repository.

## 4. Acceptance boundary

Passing the checks above verifies the Tranche 1 record-and-generate milestone. It does not
claim the Tranche 2 dry-run report, agent skill, wallet install flow, hosted endpoint, or three
integration walkthroughs. It also does not claim the Tranche 3 production service, independent
security audit, audit remediation, OpenZeppelin sign-off, or mainnet wallet integration.

Those boundaries are normative in `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `docs/SCOPE.md`. Historical
live-network observations are in `docs/TESTNET-EVIDENCE.md`; the scheduled workflow is the
freshness check for an external network that can change after evidence is recorded.

## Reviewer checklist

- [ ] The revision under review is identified.
- [ ] `scripts/verify-phase1.sh` finishes with the full release-gate success message.
- [ ] `scripts/demo-tranche1.sh` exits zero against live testnet.
- [ ] The generated policy compiles unmodified and its manifest identities reconcile.
- [ ] Regeneration is byte-identical.
- [ ] The tampered account-code input is refused, not synthesized.
- [ ] The MCP recording and synthesis surface matches the contracted v0 scope.
- [ ] Later-tranche exclusions are not counted as missing Tranche 1 work.
